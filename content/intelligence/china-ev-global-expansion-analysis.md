A new "Age of Great Voyages" is unfolding on the global automotive industry map, and this time, the mother port of the mighty fleet is in China. Since 2023, I have witnessed China's electric vehicles (EVs) sail into the world with unprecedented momentum. Many observers attribute this phenomenon simply to "internal competition" within the Chinese domestic market, viewing it as a forced "great escape."

Here, I will present my core argument: this perspective is one-sided and severely underestimates the strategic intent and deeper driving forces behind this historic process. While it is indeed catalyzed by internal pressures, it is more importantly a proactive global expansion rooted in a decade of technological accumulation, a complete supply chain construction, and unique business model innovation. This is not merely "product export," but a comprehensive output of "systems" and "standards."

In this report, I will take you deep into four core aspects of this expedition: the "storms and currents" driving the voyage, the "flagship fleets" leading the way, the meticulously drawn "global maps," and the "core technologies and ultimate challenges" that will determine the future.

This is my complete interpretation of the great transformation that is unfolding.



### Part 1: Storms and Currents—An Invincible Fleet Forged in a Furnace of Competition

To understand why and how China's fleet is embarking on this voyage, we must first examine the mother port where they were born. In my view, China's EV market has evolved into an unprecedented "furnace of competition" in human commercial history.

### 1.1 The "Furnace" Effect: Super Evolution Under a Price War

Since 2023, the price war has been the most intense flame in this furnace. Our exclusive data shows that this war is not merely a "collective price drop," but a dramatic "song of ice and fire" played out by different brands based on their own strengths.
