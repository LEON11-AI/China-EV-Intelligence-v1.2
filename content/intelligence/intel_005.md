According to sources within BYD's European supply chain, the company is targeting Q4 2024 to begin trial production of the BYD Seal at its new manufacturing plant in Szeged, Hungary. This marks a significant step in BYD's localization strategy for the European market. The move is expected to shorten delivery times and reduce logistical costs, potentially allowing for more competitive pricing. Our sources indicate that the initial production will focus on the rear-wheel-drive version of the Seal, with the all-wheel-drive performance model to follow in early 2025. We are actively monitoring hiring and equipment installation at the plant to verify this timeline.
