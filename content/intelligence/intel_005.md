According to sources within BYD's European supply chain, the company is targeting Q4 2024 to begin trial production of the BYD Seal at its new manufacturing plant in Szeged, Hungary. This marks a significant step in BYD's localization strategy for the European market.

## Plant Details

### Location and Capacity

This move positions BYD as a serious competitor in the European EV market, joining other Chinese manufacturers like MG and Polestar in establishing local production. The Hungary plant represents BYD's largest European investment and signals long-term commitment to the region.

## Analysis

BYD's Hungary plant strategy reflects the broader trend of Chinese EV manufacturers establishing European production to avoid potential tariffs and demonstrate market commitment. This localization approach is crucial for competing with established European brands and meeting growing European EV demand.
