Several photos have surfaced on Chinese social media platform Weibo, allegedly showing a facelifted version of the Li Auto L9. The images reveal minor cosmetic tweaks, including a redesigned front bumper with integrated daytime running lights and a new wheel design. While the source of the leak is unverified, the changes appear consistent with a mid-cycle refresh. We are cross-referencing these images with supplier information to determine their authenticity. If true, this indicates Li Auto is accelerating its product refresh cycle to compete with new market entrants. Pro members have access to our full image analysis and an assessment of the potential impact on L9's sales.
