# Test Auto Push Feature

This is a test article to verify that the auto-push functionality works correctly.

When this file is created, the content watcher should:
1. Detect the file change
2. Sync the content to intelligence.json
3. Automatically push changes to GitHub

This ensures that CMS updates are immediately reflected in the frontend without manual intervention.
