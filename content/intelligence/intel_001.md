The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) of China has officially published the declaration for NIO's upcoming flagship, the ET9. This filing provides the final, verified specifications for the production model ahead of its market launch. Key details confirmed include the exact battery capacity, motor power output for the dual-motor setup, and official curb weight. Our analysis shows a slight increase in battery density compared to earlier prototypes, suggesting a last-minute cell chemistry improvement from CATL. This is the most concrete data available to date and solidifies expectations for the ET9's performance. The full filing includes detailed dimensions, tire specifications, and optional equipment configurations, which are critical for competitive analysis. We have broken down the full specification sheet and compared it against the Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV and other ultra-luxury competitors.
