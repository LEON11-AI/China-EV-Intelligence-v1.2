Xiaomi Auto has officially pushed its latest Over-the-Air (OTA) update, version 2.1, to all SU7 models. The update primarily focuses on enhancing the vehicle's Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Key improvements include more responsive lane-keeping assist on curved roads and better object detection for cyclists and pedestrians in low-light conditions. The update also includes minor bug fixes for the infotainment system.
