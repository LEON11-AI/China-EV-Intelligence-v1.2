title: "Zeekr 001 FR"
brand: "Zeekr"
model: "001 FR"
status: "limited_production"
ceo_note: "Zeekr's 001 FR is a direct assault on the Tesla Model S Plaid. With quad motors and tank-turn capabilities, it's a showcase of Geely's engineering prowess. This is less about sales and more about proving that Chinese EVs can compete at the highest level of performance."
