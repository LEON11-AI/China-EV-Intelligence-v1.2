Charging station coverage is less than 1/10 of gas stations, meaning EV users face significant charging inconvenience.</p>\n                        <p class=\"text-neutral-600\">The Japanese government has long allocated 95% of infrastructure budget to hydrogen stations, neglecting charging station construction, leading to lagging new energy vehicle infrastructure development. Japan's METI initially planned to install 150,000 EV chargers by 2030, but later had to raise the target to 300,000.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <div>\n                        <h4 class=\"text-lg font-medium text-neutral-700 mb-3 flex items-center\">\n                            <span class=\"w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-primary text-white text-xs flex items-center justify-center mr-2\">2</span>\n                            Narrow Parking Spaces and Vehicle Compatibility Issues\n                        </h4>\n                        <p class=\"text-neutral-600\">Urban parking spaces in Japan are generally narrow, especially in major cities like Tokyo. Many BYD models exceed the 1.85-meter width limit of Japan's mechanical multi-story parking garages. Sales representative Taisei Ichinose stated that parking difficulties have caused many potential customers to ultimately abandon purchasing BYD vehicles. BYD Dolphin's overall height in Japan has been adjusted to 1,550mm to accommodate common size restrictions in Japanese mechanical parking garages.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <div>\n                        <h4 class=\"text-lg font-medium text-neutral-700 mb-3 flex items-center\">\n                            <span class=\"w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-primary text-white text-xs flex items-center justify-center mr-2\">3</span>\n                            Market Demand for Compact Vehicles\n                        </h4>\n                        <p class=\"text-neutral-600\">Facing the reality of narrow parking spaces, Japanese consumers have strong demand for compact vehicles. The K-Car (light automobile) market accounts for nearly 40% of Japan's new car sales, with the best-selling model being the Honda N-Box, priced around 80,000 yuan, which has dominated for years. BYD is planning to launch EVs in Japan's light vehicle sector in the second half of 2026 and aims to increase its dealer network from 64 to 100 stores by the end of this year, an increase of over 50%.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <!-- 2.2 经济陷阱 -->\n            <div class=\"bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm p-6 md:p-8 mb-8\">\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-700 mb-5\">2.2 The Economic Trap</h3>\n                \n                <div class=\"space-y-6\">\n                    <div>\n                        <h4 class=\"text-lg font-medium text-neutral-700 mb-3 flex items-center\">\n                            <span class=\"w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-primary text-white text-xs flex items-center justify-center mr-2\">1</span>\n                            High Battery Replacement Costs\n                        </h4>\n                        <p class=\"mb-4 text-neutral-600\">High battery replacement costs are a significant economic factor for Japanese consumers rejecting electric vehicles.
