    "content": "A new \"Age of Great Voyages\" is unfolding on the global automotive industry map, and this time, the mother port of the mighty fleet is in China. Since 2023, I have witnessed China's electric vehicles (EVs) sail into the world with unprecedented momentum. Many observers attribute this phenomenon simply to \"internal competition\" within the Chinese domestic market, viewing it as a forced \"great escape.\"\n\nHere, I will present my core argument: this perspective is one-sided and severely underestimates the strategic intent and deeper driving forces behind this historic process. While it is indeed catalyzed by internal pressures, it is more importantly a proactive global expansion rooted in a decade of technological accumulation, a complete supply chain construction, and unique business model innovation. This is not merely \"product export,\" but a comprehensive output of \"systems\" and \"standards.\"\n\nIn this report, I will take you deep into four core aspects of this expedition: the \"storms and currents\" driving the voyage, the \"flagship fleets\" leading the way, the meticulously drawn \"global maps,\" and the \"core technologies and ultimate challenges\" that will determine the future.\n\nThis is my complete interpretation of the great transformation that is unfolding.\n\n\n\n### Part 1: Storms and Currents—An Invincible Fleet Forged in a Furnace of Competition\n\nTo understand why and how China's fleet is embarking on this voyage, we must first examine the mother port where they were born. In my view, China's EV market has evolved into an unprecedented \"furnace of competition\" in human commercial history.\n\n### 1.1 The \"Furnace\" Effect: Super Evolution Under a Price War\n\nSince 2023, the price war has been the most intense flame in this furnace. Our exclusive data shows that this war is not merely a \"collective price drop,\" but a dramatic \"song of ice and fire\" played out by different brands based on their own strengths.\n\n![](/images/uploads/t1.png)\n\nFigure 1: Average Selling Price (ASP) Trends of Major Chinese New Energy Brands (2022 Q1 - 2024 Q4)\n\nThis chart reveals four distinctly different survival curves. Tesla China (purple line) steadily dropped from a high of 525,000 RMB to 362,000 RMB, acting as the \"metronome\" for high-end market prices. NIO (blue line), after holding ground at 370,000-380,000 RMB in 2022, experienced a cliff-like decline in Q1 2023, sliding to 241,000 RMB—a huge price paid for gaining market share. XPeng (green line) continuously declined from 225,000 RMB to the 159,000 RMB range.\n\nBut the true \"anchor\" is BYD (orange line). Amid immense pressure for price reductions across the industry, its ASP remained stable between 140,000-160,000 RMB over two years. This remarkable price resilience directly proves its unparalleled cost control capabilities and absolute dominance in the mainstream market.\n\nData Source: VOLT CHINA Exclusive Database\n\nThis extreme competitive environment has cultivated three decisive evolutionary advantages: ultimate cost control capability, \"light-speed\" innovation cycles, and strong supply chain resilience. Therefore, I believe that domestic \"internal competition\" is not merely consumption; it is more like a rigorous \"selection process\" and \"training camp.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n### Part 2: Flagship Fleets—Four Distinct Modes of Global Expansion\n\nIn Europe, a key battleground, the first half-year results of various fleets have preliminarily revealed their current strength and position.\n\n![](/images/uploads/t2.png)\n\nFigure 2: Sales Performance of Chinese New Energy Brands in the European Market (H1 2025)\n\nThe data is brutal and direct. The bar chart shows that SAIC MG leads the pack with an astonishing 115,000 units sold, making it the undisputed \"Expedition Commander.\" In contrast, XPeng achieved 8,338 units, placing it in the second tier, reflecting the initial difficulty of market penetration as a high-end challenger.\n\nData Source: VOLT CHINA Exclusive Database\n\nNext, I will delve into the strategies behind some of the most representative fleets, revealing the strategic intentions behind the numbers.\n\nSAIC MG: The \"Pioneer of Penetration\" with Broad Coverage\n\nI define SAIC MG's strategy as \"Broad Penetration and Value Positioning.\" Its success is a perfect combination of \"European brand DNA,\" \"Chinese supply chain efficiency,\" and \"precise market targeting.\"\n\nBYD: The \"Ocean Overlord\" Winning with Systems\n\nBYD's strategy is \"Systematic Expedition.\" It exports not just cars but an entire set of solutions based on its vertically integrated capabilities. It is preparing for a more enduring and comprehensive war.\n\nNIO and XPeng: The \"Innovative Explorers\" Driven by Technology\n\nNIO and XPeng represent another route: challenging the old order of the high-end market with disruptive technology and business models.\n\n![](/images/uploads/t3.png)\n\nFigure 3: Strategic Positioning Analysis of Chinese New Energy Brands (H1 2025)\n\nThis scatter plot is my core tool for evaluating brand strategic intentions. The Y-axis represents \"Innovation Level,\" and the X-axis represents \"Market Coverage Breadth.\" NIO and Li Auto occupy the quadrant of \"High Innovation, Low Coverage,\" typical \"niche market pioneers.\" XPeng lies in the middle ground between innovation and market coverage. SAIC MG, on the other hand, is clearly positioned in the \"Broad Coverage, Moderate Innovation\" quadrant, a classic approach for \"mass market leaders.\"\n\nData Source: VOLT CHINA Exclusive Database\n\n\n\n### Part 3: Global Maps—Tailored Strategies for Three Key Battlefields\n\n### 3.1 European Battlefield: High-Value \"Normandy Landing\"\n\nEurope, in my eyes, is the \"main battlefield\" of this global expedition. The landing points and operational radii of various brands exhibit significant differentiation.\n\n![](/images/uploads/t4.png)\n\nFigure 4: Market Coverage and Layout Heatmap of Chinese New Energy Brands in Europe (H1 2025)\n\nLeft Chart (Radar Chart): The \"Brand Coverage\" radar chart clearly reveals two different expansion strategies. SAIC MG demonstrates a \"networked strategy\" with coverage across nearly 20 countries. In contrast, NIO and Li Auto adopt a more focused \"point-to-point breakthrough\" strategy.\n\nRight Chart (Heatmap): The \"Brand-Region Layout Heatmap\" further reveals geographic preferences. SAIC MG and BYD show strong market performance in Western Europe, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe, while NIO and XPeng clearly concentrate their strategic focus on the high-end markets of Western Europe and Northern Europe.\n\nData Source: VOLT CHINA Exclusive Database\n\nMeanwhile, infrastructure construction is the logistical lifeline determining the success of the landing battle.\n\n![](/images/uploads/t5.png)\n\nFigure 5: Distribution of Infrastructure by Chinese New Energy Brands in Europe (H1 2025)\n\nThe pie chart data is astounding: SAIC MG's service outlets account for 92.1% of the total infrastructure established by Chinese brands in Europe. This is not just the result of sales but the cornerstone for sustained growth in the future.\n\nData Source: VOLT CHINA Exclusive Database\n\n### 3.2 Southeast Asian Battlefield: A Disruptive \"Blitzkrieg\"\n\nIf Europe is a \"landing battle,\" Southeast Asia is an outright \"blitzkrieg.\" Here, Chinese brands, with mature EV products, launched a \"dimensional reduction strike\" against the slow-transitioning Japanese traditional giants.\n\n![](/images/uploads/t6.png)\n\nFigure 6: Market Share Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Brands in ASEAN Countries (2021 vs 2024)\n\nThis chart showcases a shocking power shift. In just three years:\n\n· In Thailand, Chinese brands' EV market share surged from 2% to 89%, while Japanese brands fell from 85% dominance to 8%.\n\n· In Indonesia, the same story unfolded, with Chinese brands rising from 3% to 80%, and Japanese brands plummeting from 92% to 15%.\n\n· In Malaysia, although Japanese brands still lead with 45% market share, they have lost nearly half their territory, while Chinese brands' share jumped from 1% to 35%.\n\nData Source: VOLT CHINA Exclusive Database\n\nThese data eloquently prove how fragile the old market structure is on the new EV track. This is not just a product victory but a triumph of strategic foresight and market responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Part 4: Future Directions—Opportunities, Challenges, and My Final Judgment\n\nWhere will this Age of Great Voyages lead? The timeline of key events provides some clues.\n\n![](/images/uploads/t07.png)\n\nFigure 7: Timeline of Key Events in 2025\n\nThis timeline shows that from early to mid-year, the number of critical strategic events (such as entering new markets, releasing new technologies) is accelerating. This indicates that Chinese brands' European offensive is showing a clear \"upgrade and acceleration\" trend in the first half of 2025.\n\nData Source: VOLT CHINA Exclusive Database\n\n### My Conclusion and Quantitative Predictions\n\nThis EV \"Age of Great Voyages\" initiated by China is irreversible. Here are two quantitative predictions based on my analytical models:\n\n1. \\[Capacity Prediction] I predict that by the end of 2026, at least three Chinese brands (or their holding groups, such as BYD, SAIC Group, and Geely Group) will have a combined local production capacity of over 300,000 units annually in Europe.\n\n2. \\[Product Structure Prediction] I further predict that by 2027, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) will account for 35% or more of Chinese brands' total sales in Europe, becoming a key weapon against tariff barriers.\n\nUltimately, I believe we will witness a fundamental transformation. Chinese companies will no longer aim to sell more \"metal boxes\" but to become globally leading mobility service providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Strategic Insights (Key Takeaways for Our Subscribers)\n\nThis report is not just an analysis; it is your business compass.\n\n· For Investors: Shift your focus from mere sales numbers to the quality of companies' globalization. Evaluate the depth (factories, R&D, supply chains) and speed of their \"localization,\" which will be the core driver of enterprise valuation in the next phase.\n\n· For Industry Executives: If your company is still stuck in the mindset of \"product export,\" the strategic window is closing. Immediate consideration of systematic and localized competitive strategies is imperative.\n\n· For Supply Chain Partners: The \"flagship fleets'\" direction is your direction. Follow your core customers overseas and proactively establish production or service bases in Europe and Southeast Asia—this will be the largest and most predictable growth opportunity in the next five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: All opinions in this report are personal judgments based on publicly available information and professional analysis, provided exclusively for VOLT CHINA paid subscribers.
