summary: >-
  Japan's electric vehicle market is facing severe challenges. In the first half
  of 2025, Japan's EV sales declined by 7% year-over-year, marking the second
  consecutive year of decline. Data from the Japan Automobile Dealers
  Association and the Japan Mini Vehicles Association shows that in February
  2025, Japan's EV sales (passenger cars only) plummeted 20% year-over-year to
  4,390 units, representing 16 consecutive months of market contraction.


  From a market penetration perspective, Japan's EV market performance is equally concerning. From January to August 2025, Japan's total EV sales were approximately 33,600 units, while passenger car sales totaled 2.41 million units, resulting in a pure EV penetration rate of only 1.4%, declining for two consecutive years. This figure is far below the global average and even lower than many developing countries.
